# Helios

A minimalistic CMS using Node.js and React.

We use Bulma as CSS Framework, next.js for Server Side Rendering and Slate as Content Editor.

## Why?

There are tons of CMS out there. Wordpress dwarfs the market with tons of extensions and great support. So why another one?

There are two very simple reasons why I wrote Helios:

- I want something simple. No monolythic codebase behind the scenes, no uncertainty what happens with my data.
- I'm not a fan of PHP, which most popular CMS are written in. It's a battle proven language, but I believe that the technology has exceeded its lifespan.

Why should you *use* Helios?

- Helios is lightweight - Low resource usage on the server, fast load speeds for your visitors.
- Helios was developed with a mobile first approach.
- Helios is easily forkable - Getting into the codebase and changing things to your liking isn't difficult.
- Helios is MIT licensed - You can do WHATEVER you want with it.

Why should you *not use* Helios?

- Helios does not offer a plugin system.
- Helios is mainly aimed at developers. If you want to customize something, you are required to touch a code file.
